# Fragen fÃ¼r SambaNova
* Data augmentation on GPU possible? -> compile that or inefficient and better done on CPU?
* is an AWS in NA West okay for data download?
* Can we have access to the DOCs or should i just leave my code for gpu and SambaNova puts their model in?
* can we log to Weights and Biases during training or only offline logging?
* how many runs can we do?
